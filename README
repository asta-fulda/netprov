This is netprov, a network configuration provisioning utility.


I. About
========
netprov is used to generate configuration files for network daemons out of a
network management software.


II. Concepts
============
netprov reads a configuration file on startup containing mappings between
sources and target files.

A source is a named provider for network information, like available subnets and
configured IP addresses. The source is configured globally and utilizes a single
network management system.

A mapping is configured for a target file path. To generate the content of the
file, a source and a formatter must be configured for the mapping.

During the program run, the source configured for a mapping is passed to the
formatter which generates the file content. After the run, the old content of
the files is compared to the new ones. If the content differs, a configurable
action can be triggered.


III. Installation
=================
See INSTALL.


IV. Licensing
=============
See LICENSE.


V. Usage
========
The program is intended to be called on a regular interval, i.e. using cron.

The configuration file to use can be specified as a command line parameter. If
no file is specified, the file /etc/netprov.conf will be used.


VI. Configuration
=================
The configuration is specified in a file using the JSON format. For a detailed
specification see JSON web site ( http://json.org/ ).

The configuration consists of two sections, the source section configuring all
available sources and the mappings sections containing all the target files.

The sources is a dictionary of the source name to the source configuration. The
following elements are allowed in a source configuration:
  class         the name of the source class
  config        the configuration of the source

The mapping is a dictionary of the target file and the mapping configuration. The
following elements are allowed in a mapping configuration:
  class          the name of the mapping class
  source         the name of the source to utilize in the mapping
  config         the configuration of the formatter
  action         an optional action to trigger after a file change

For an example of the configuration file, see netprov.conf.example.
